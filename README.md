## Membership by Delegated Staking
### dDai allows creators to capitalize on their social capital without charging their community anything.

Creators can offer access to services based on the amount of staked dai, which they receive the interest on.

Users deposit dai and receive dDai, which represents their level of membership.  They can withdraw their funds at any time.
